Started with files found here: [Food ordering app](https://github.com/academind/react-complete-guide-course-resources/blob/main/attachments/18%20Practice%20Project%20-%20Food%20Order/01-starting-project.zip), as a part of this course: [Dive in and learn React.js from scratch! Learn React, Hooks, Redux, React Router, Next.js, Best Practices and way more!](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-the-complete-guide-incl-redux/)

I challanged myself to complete the project without watching the instructor's solution.
